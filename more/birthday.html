            <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming here today for my birthday. I'd like to say a few words before the party goes on. You know, I have always identified myself as a public speaker, so how could I miss this opportunity to make a toast to everyone. </p>
            <p>21 years ago, I was born in the suburb of a small city in China. When I open the window of my home, I can see the mountains. I know this might sound poetic to you, but living in the rural area more often means isolation, poverty, and scarcity.  So at the age of 11, I went to the provincial capital for my middle school. Since then, I embarked on a journey of exploring a bigger world, on my own. After 6 years in the provincial capital, I went to Shanghai for my university, where I see an even bigger part of this amazing world. Then after staying there for 4 years, I decided to come to Hong Kong for exchange. So it's been a long journey for me to come to this moment, and destiny has brought me to meet you all. And I feel very lucky.</p>
            <p>But I'm not here just to talk about myself, I'm here to talk about us. All of us are brave explorers who decided to dive into a completely new city and were ready to embrace something completely exotic or even strange. So cheers to all of us for going this far and doing an incredible job! And because we are all strangers to this city, the bond we have is particularly strong and precious. So I wanna say, it's a huge pleasure knowing you all and it might be the most precious thing during my exchange. What I like most about us, is that we are so different in whatever ways. We come from different countries, have different skin colors, speak different languages, and live different lives. And growing up seeing a bigger world little by little, I have come to realize how important it is to always meet new people to reimagine what's possible in our own lives. I'm always amazed, by how each of you has lived such a wonderful life. And I'm always inspired by it. So thank you, for being so diverse, kind, energetic, and generous. </p>
            <p>But, sometimes I wonder, we are so different. Can we really understand and sympathize with each other? Because admit it or not, we are living in a more and more isolated world, and our ancestors have had countless combats and fights with each other. And now there is so much distrust, opposition, and hostility existing among our countries. Do we really have more in common than that which divides us? This question had bothered me for quite a while. Because I'm the kind of person that believes in the Olympics, in the United Nations, and in a world where people are kind to each other despite all our differences. But I feel very lucky, that during my interactions with all of you, I have a stronger and stronger belief that we do share something that transcends all our differences, our skin colors, languages, nationalities, ideologies, and life experiences. I can feel it from the kindness and love that we share with each other. </p>
            <p>I know that in a few weeks, or even a few days, we'll go on our separate ways and we don't know when we'll see each other again. But it's fine. I really like the line from the movie Nomadland, it says, <em>One of the things I love most about this life is that there's no final goodbye. I've met hundreds of people out here and I don't ever say a final goodbye. I always just say, "I'll see you down the road." And I do, I see them again, and I can be certain in my heart, I will see you again.</em></p>
            <p>So, tonight, I stand before you with only one agenda, to let you know my heart is yours and will always be, wherever we are. And tonight, don't just celebrate for me, but also for you, for kindness, for love, for all of us. Thank you, enjoy!</p>
